         * even when the outer function is done running, we can still maintain the outerVar in
         * memory to access it at a later time from innerFn().

         * Since our inner scope references a variable that was created in our outer scope, that is what is referred to as closure.
         * We still are able to access our outer variables inside of the outer function scope, inside of our inner even after the createGreeting() function has been closed over. That is the whole idea behind closures, it's been closed.
         * That is the first example where you have functions inside of functions and they are able to access the closure data inside of that.
